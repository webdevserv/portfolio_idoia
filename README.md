As ML is an interest of mine, I am creating web apps in streamlit with python code of useful applications. I have an AI degree and I am passionate about web and ML. Django will be also used shortly to deploy some of the models.
We utilities that I have place in either Hugging Face, Streamlit or Github as part of my portfolio.  

1. **LIVE Deep Zoom image app**
Allows users to zoom in and explore high-resolution images with ease.[https://webdevserv-portfolio-idoia-icodeidoia-portfolio-9kblei.streamlit.app/LIVE_Deep_Zoom_image_app]
2. **LIVE Remove Bg app**
My number 1 useful app. Removes the background from images, making them suitable for various purposes. [https://webdevserv-portfolio-idoia-icodeidoia-portfolio-9kblei.streamlit.app/LIVE_Remove_Bg_app]
3. **LIVE Square Filler app** two flavors one with a streamlit component tha that you pip install the other one without. [https://webdevserv-portfolio-idoia-icodeidoia-portfolio-9kblei.streamlit.app/LIVE_Square_Filler_app]
This utility takes a landscape image and squares it neatly. It uses a color filler as needed.
