# portfolio_idoia

As ML is an interest of mine, I am creating web apps in streamlit with python code of useful applications. I have an AI degree and I am passionate about web and ML. Django will be also used shortly to deploy some of the models.
We utilities that I have place in either Hugging Face, Streamlit or Github as part of my portfolio.  

1. **LIVE Deep Zoom image app**
Allows users to zoom in and explore high-resolution images with ease.
2. **LIVE Remove Bg app**
My number 1 useful app. Removes the background from images, making them suitable for various purposes.
3. **LIVE Square Filler app**
This utility takes a landscape image and squares it neatly. It uses a color filler as needed.
4. **LIVE Image 2 OCR**
Converts text from images into machine-readable text using optical character recognition (OCR).
5. **LIVE Dalle Image Generator app**
Creates unique and imaginative images using the DALL-E model.
6. **LIVE Stock Predictor**
Predicts stock prices and trends based on historical data.
