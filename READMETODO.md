# portfolio_idoia

As ML is an interest of mine, I am creating web apps in streamlit with python code of useful applications. I have an AI degree and I am passionate about web and ML. Django will be also used shortly to deploy some of the models.

There are three web application demonstrated in the repository:

1.- # Super Resoluution app

This application demonstrates how SRGAN model can generate a super-resolution image from a low-resolution input.

2.- # Square and Fill appliaton app

This utility takes a landscape image and squares it neatly. It uses a color filler as needed.

3.- # Dall-e image creation showcases from OpenAI

Generates Artificial images using the Dall-e application from OpenAI
