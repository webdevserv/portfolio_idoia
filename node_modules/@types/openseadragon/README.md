# portfolio_idoia

As ML is an interest of mine, I am creating web apps in streamlit with python code of useful applications. I have an AI degree and I am passionate about web and ML. Django will be also used shortly to deploy some of the models.

There are three web application demonstrated in the repository:

1.- # Idoia Portfolio app

Link to my website and portfolio introductory page.

2.- # Remove Background app

It will remove the background of an image.

3.- # Deep Zoom image app

This application demonstrates open sea dragon viewer using Microsoft deep zoom *.dzi file format.

4.- # Square and Fill applicaton app

This utility uses CV2 image utility, takes a landscape image and squares it neatly. It uses a average color filler as needed.

5.- # Dall-e image creation showcases from OpenAI

Generates Artificial images using the Dall-e application from OpenAI.
